## A Brief History of the Project

The idea for this project was inspired by my love for taking Buzzfeed quizzes.
But as much as i love how random buzzfeed quizzes can be, I wanted this game to be a relatable experience for those of us that grew up in Singapore. Hence I came up with a Singapore Theme Trivia Game. From there, I came up with 3 categories (Food, General Knowledge and Singlish).
All the questions in the game are largely based on things I've experienced while growing up in Singapore to becoming a working adult. So I hope this game brings joy to you as well!	:smile_cat:

## User Story

User should be able to:

1. View the main page which shows the title of the Trivia and 3 corresponding categories
2. Click into any 3 of the categories 
3. View a question and 3 available answers
4. Choose any 1 of the given answers to lock in their answer
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until they have reach the last question
6. View player's total score at the last page with a corresponding message and a gif

## Summary
Overall, I enjoyed making this project from scratch. It was not easy to think like a programmer and translate my thoughts into code. It was especially tough in the beginning as there wasn't much references online for a quiz game like this. It got better after I start to break things down step by step and focusing on getting small components to work.
